      <p><b>my favorite things: music</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>listen to music? that's crazy, me too. Bands that I've fixated on and listen to a bit too much are They Might Be Giants, Ween, David Byrne (solo music mainly), the Mountain Goats (kind of?) and currently... Weezer <em>*everyone boos*</em><br>I'm planning on adding more pages to show/ talk about my music and memorabilia collections, but for now you can check it out on my <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/bazluhrmam/collection" target="_blank">discogs account!</a> (which needs updating)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>my favorite things: other?</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>the two categories of life, music and other - my favorite movie is True Stories (1986) and I'm also currently interested in silent era film. I would LOVE to add a page sometime in the future for silent film resources I've been using, much like my language page. And to also have a place to write about them too!<br>I also like to make art in my spare time, and occasionally play my bass when I remember to</li>
