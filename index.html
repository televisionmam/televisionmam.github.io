        <li>Art and Lang are basically set and ready to go as of today! I cannot speak for their future though. Only the Home and About pages need sprucing up - new backgrounds and maybe more images or styling, but I'm constrained for now since this is due tomorrow. But even with those lacking points this is big step up compared to the state my site was in 2 years ago!</li>
