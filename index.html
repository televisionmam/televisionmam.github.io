        <p>welcome! please step into my almost fully furnished website, there’s plenty of links to click and images to inspect. Check out one of the aptly named pages above and hopefully discover something new. There will be more to come in the following months so keep your eyes peeled for updates, and enjoy your stay!</p>

        <li>the sprucing has been spruced. more information was added to my about page in a semi stylish way. my plans for this sites future is to fix some design choices I don't love, and add pages to write about my music collections! then adding more resource pages for my favorite websites that I use a lot, general things like that.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>art and lang are basically set and ready to go as of today! I cannot speak for their future though. only the home and about pages need sprucing up - new backgrounds and maybe more images or styling, but I'm constrained for now since this is due tomorrow. even with those lacking points though this is big step up compared to the state my site was in 2 years ago!</li>
